      "# Getting Started with Salt\n",
      "###### Peter Baumgartner (Founder of Lincoln Loop)\n",
      "\n",
      "## What is SaltStack?\n",
      "* Configuration management\n",
      "* remote execution:w\n",
      " * deploy\n",
      " * one-off scripts\n",
      " * monitoring\n",
      "\n",
      "## Why SaltStack?\n",
      "* Familiar tools: Python, YAML, Jinja2\n",
      "* No new DSL or language to learn\n",
      "* Great docs (> 800 pages)\n",

      "* Not SSH (support is \"alpha\")\n",
      "\n",
      "## Vocab\n",
      "* master: controls everything\n",
      "* minion: server controlled by a master\n",
      "* (sub)state: declarative representation of system state\n",
      "* grain: static piece of information about a minion\n",
      "* pillar: variables for one or more minions\n",
      "* top file: matches states or pillars to minions\n",
      "* highstate: all the state data for a minion\n",
      "\n",
      "## Installation\n",
      "* binaries for most distros\n",
      "* pip install\n",

      "\n",
      "### Install and setup\n",
      "```\n",
      "    # apt-get install salt-master  # can also run master-less\n",
      "    # apt-get install salt-minion\n",
      "    # echo \"salt 10.10.1.1\" >> /etc/hosts\n",
      "    # salt-key -a minion.lincolnloop.com  # accept the minion key on the minion\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Write a state\n",
      "* /srv/salt/mystate.sls:\n",
      "```\n",
      "    nginx:\n",
      "      pkg.installed\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Write a top file\n",
      "* /srv/salt/top.sls\n",
      "```\n",
      "    base:\n",
      "      myserver:\n",
      "        - mystate\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Highstate\n",
      "```\n",
      "    # salt 'myserver' state.highstate\n",
      "    # salt-call state.highstate\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### States\n",
      "* user, ssh_auth, pip, etc.\n",
      "* lots built-in\n",
      "\n",
      "### Pillars\n",
      "* accessible from jinja templates, as are grains, woo!\n",
      "\n",
      "### Other things to look up\n",
      "* Salt-cloud\n",
      " * talk to AWS, Rackspace, etc.\n",
      "* Custom modules\n",
      "* Scheduler\n",
      " * like cron; good for system monitoring\n",
      "* Renderers\n",
      "* Returners\n",
      " * return output to email instead of console, for example\n",
      " * graphite, sentry, syslog, etc.\n",
      "* Reactor\n",
      " * hook into events in communication bus\n",
      "\n",
      "### Tips and Tricks\n",
      "* default output is very verbose; set output_mode: mixed\n",
      "* Jinja2 is powerful, but don't go nuts\n",
      "* update often and review the change log\n",
      "* tst before you deploy; make friends with Vagrant or Docker\n"
