      "Unit Testing makes your code more beautiful. Beautiful is better code.\n",
      "* easier to understand\n",

      "* why does it exist?\n",
      "* where does it come from?\n",
      "* what requirements does it meet?\n",

      "### Their code measures the Internet\n",
      "* lots of pings\n",
      "* lots of traceroutes\n",

      "### Where to start testing?\n",
      "* You can't test an object if you can't construct it, so start with the constructor!\n",
      "* The goes double if the constructors does interesting things\n",
      "* Write tests to cover all code paths\n",

      "### What did this help with?\n",
      "* writing the tests made me look deeper\n",
      "* make me read the code very carefully\n",
