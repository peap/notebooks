      "* Abstracting DBs is hard\n",
      " * Generally true for abstracting\n",
      "* Composability rocks\n",
      " * It's simplified the code so much\n",
      " * Makes migration squashing much easier\n",
      "* Feedback is vital\n",
      " * I'm just not mad enough to do nasty things to my code\n",
