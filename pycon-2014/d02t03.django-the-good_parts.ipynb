      "# Django: The Good Parts\n",
      "###### James Bennett (Release Manager for Django)\n",
      "\n",
      "* July 2005: Initial public preview\n",
      "* Now: 160 kLOC of Python in Django 1.7\n",
      "\n",
      "Aren't other frameworks smaller/lighter and thus better?\n",
      "\n",
      "## The Good Parts\n",
      "* HTTP abstraction + request/response cycle\n",
      "* Conservative (really!) approach to features\n",
      "* The secret weapons: apps\n",
      "\n",
      "## HTTP Abstraction\n",
      "\n",
      "### HTTP sucks\n",
      "* Nine different request methods with big differences\n",
      "* Unicode-unaware\n",
      "* Persistence, auth ,streaming, security al tacked on/afterthoughts\n",
      "\n",
      "### CGI isn't great, either\n",
      "* How to CGI\n",
      " * Write script to be invoked by web server; request information will be in environment variables\n",
      " * submitted data received via standar input\n",
      " * script does it processing\n",
      "* How CGI is *actually* done\n",
      " * Script *maybe* invoked by web server\n",
      " * `chmod 777` *everything*\n",
      " * environment is full of LIES\n",
      " * give up figuring out what the actual request URL was\n",
      " \n",
      "### WSGI is basically CGI with a bit of Python\n",
      "* Having a standard is good, but...\n",
      " * It's CGI-style; you to constantly reparse environment variables\n",
      " * signaling up and down the stack requires inventing ad-hoc protocols\n",
      " * return/response API sucks\n",
      " * inherits HTTP's awful approach to character encoding\n",
      "\n",
      "### We can do better\n",
      "* `HttpRequest`\n",
      " * already parsed and normalize for you\n",
      " * sensible attribute and dictionary-based access\n",
      " * relatively san handling of character encoding\n",
      "* `HttpResponse`\n",
      " * easy to construct and manipulate\n",
      " * convenient sublcasses for common specialed responses (404, redirect, etc.)\n",
      "* Write a callable that takes a `HttpRequest` and returns an `HttpResponse`\n",
      "* Write simple URL routing\n",
      "\n",
      "### Life cycle\n",
      "* Middleware system baked in... all middleware systems suck, though\n",
      "* Signals!\n",
      "* Decorators!\n",
      "* Call other stuff - it's callables all the way down\n",
      "\n",
      "### Django does PEP 333 so you don't have to\n",
      "* A Django project is a WSGI application\n",
      "* `wsgi.py` + `WSGI_APPLICATION`\n",
      "\n",
      "*Sane HTTP/WSGI is worth importing some stuff*\n",
      "\n",
      "## Compassionate Conservatism\n",
      "\n",
      "### Features take a while to get in\n",
      "* The `truncatechars` function only took 4 years!\n",
      "* Migrations only took 6 years!\n",
      "\n",
      "### Unbundling/removing\n",
      "* `contrib.comments`\n",
      "* `contrib.databrowse`\n",
      "* `contrib.localflavor`\n",
      "* `contrib.markup`\n",
      "\n",
      "*Things are difficult to add, easier to remove. This is usually described as a bad thing.*\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conservatism\n",
      "* strong preference or community solutions (e.g., Migrations: South won the migration wars)\n",
      "* core framework more about providing API support\n",
      "* more \"swappable\" components than expected (e.g., Jinja2 instead of the template system)\n",
      "* more stability over time\n",
      "* features land when ready\n",
      "* competition often produces better solutions\n",
      "* Django stays remarkable consistent and stable... this is good!\n",
      "\n",
      "## Enc-app-sulation\n",
      "\n",
      "* A Django project is a WSGI application. But what is a Django application?\n",
      "\n",
      "## Django Applications\n",
      "* Django apps can be...\n",
      " * models\n",
      " * views\n",
      " * forms\n",
      " * etc.\n",
      " * Not generally a black box\n",
      "* Django gives you safe APIs, meaning you can make safe assumptions and safer integration\n",
      "* Django applications are encapsulated, pluggable functionality\n",
      " * Key selling point of Django\n",
      " * Apps are a secret weapon\n",
      "* A Django application can do one thing and do it well\n",
      "* [Django Packages](https://www.djangopackages.com/) lists 2,206 available apps\n",
