      "# By Your Bootstraps: Porting Your Application to Python3\n",
      "###### Tres Seaver \n",
      "\n",
      "## Objectives\n",
      "* \"Straddling\" Python 2/3 in a single codebase\n",
      "* choosing target python versions\n",
      "* porting as an iterative process\n",
      "* adding test coverage to reduce risk\n",
      "* ...\n",
      "\n",
      "## Background\n",
      "* ~180 kLOC Python\n",
      "\n",
      "## Porting strategies\n",
      "* Port once, abandon Python2\n",
      " * *Not* The subject of this talk\n",
      " * Customers/users still need Python2\n",
      " * More feasible for applications than libraries\n",
      " * 2to3 may be useful starting point\n",
      "* \"Fix up\" at installation using 2to3\n",
      " * Ship py2 code and run 2to3 live for py3 users\n",
      " * Python2 users unaffected\n",
      " * Python3 source \"drifts\" from canonical version (bug reports don't match)\n",
      "  * Bug reports line numbers don't match\n",
      " * 2to3 *painfully slow* on large codebases\n",
      "* \"Straddling\" in a single codebase (most-used strategy today)\n",
      " * Use \"compatible subset\" of Python syntax\n",
      " * Conditional imports mask stdlib changes\n",
      " * six module can help (but you might not need it)\n",
      " * Win!\n",
      "\n",
      "## Targeting Python Versions\n",
      "* Need to do know your targeted version to \"straddle\" well\n",
      "* Python2.6 is the bare-minimum reasonable version to support\n",
      "* Python3.2 is the bare-minimum reasonable version to support\n",
      "* Syntax changes make Python2 < 2.6 hard\n",
      " * No b'' literals\n",
      " * No except Exception as e:\n",
      "* Much more cruft/pain\n",
      "* Incompatibilities make Python3 < 3.2 hard\n",
      " * PEP 3333 fixes WSGI in Py3k\n",
      " * callable() restored in 3.2\n",
      "* u'' restored in 3.3\n",
      "* Python3.2 is the \"system Python3\" in some LTS Linuxes\n",
      "* Summary: 2.6+, 3.2+; better: 2.7+, 3.3+\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## Managing Porting Risks\n",
      "* Ports are great opportunities for bug injection\n",
      "* Fear of breaking working software is the barrier\n",
      " * even more than the effort required\n",
      "* Some mitigations also improve your software\n",
      " * improved testing\n",
      " * modernized idioms in python2\n",
      " * clarity in text vs. bytes\n",
      "\n",
      "## Bottom-up Porting\n",
      "* Port packages with no dependencies first\n",
      "* Then port packages with already-ported dependencies\n",
      " * Note python versions supported by dependencies\n",
      "* Lather, rinse, repeat\n",
      "\n",
      "* \"Common subset\" idioms\n",
      "* Lennart Regebro's book: http://python3porting.com/noconv.html\n",
      "* python2.7 -3 can point out problem areas\n",
      "* \"Modernize\" idioms in Python2 code\n",
      "* Distinguishing bytes vs. text\n",
      " * use b''/u'' for *all* literals; you want to always know what you're working with, and you should be explicit\n",
      "* Adopt new syntax\n",
      " * except ... as ...\n",
      " * print()\n",
      "* Use new stdlib facilities\n",
      " * StringIO.StringIO --> io.StringIO\n",
      "\n",
      "* Testing Avoids Hair-Loss\n",
      "* Make good test coverage the first step of the porting process!\n",
      "* Untested code is where the bugs go to hide\n",
      "* 100% coverage is ideal *before* porting\n",
      " * unit testing preferable for libraries\n",
      " * functional testing best for applications\n",
      "* Measuring coverage\n",
      " * https://pypi.python.org/pypi/coverage\n",
      "* Work to improve assertions as well as coverage\n",
      " * Assert *contracts*, not implementation details\n",
      "* Doctests make straddling *really* hard\n",
      " * Think of doctests as documentation with verifiable examples\n",
      " * Replace doctests with unit/functional tests\n",
      " * If at all feasible, convert doctests to Sphinx examples\n",
      "* Automate running tests\n",
      "* tox helps ensure that tests pass under all supported versions\n",
      " * creates a virtualenv for each version and runs testing command\n",
      " * Testing with pypy and other versions\n",
      "* Testing C extensions is harder; need a reference implementation\n",
      "\n",
      "## Hygeine Issues\n",
      "* Use Trove classifiers in your setup.py file\n",
      "* Consider bumping your major version number\n",
      "* Apply continuous integration\n",
      " * Travis-CI, Jenkins, Shining Panda for Windows\n",
