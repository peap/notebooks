      "## Definitions\n",
      "* Unit testing\n",
      " * Ensure that small parts work *in isolation*\n",
      "* Integration testing\n",
      " * Ensure those poarts work well *together*\n",
      "* Functional Testing\n",
      " * ensure applcation functions well, especially from the user's perspective\n",
      " \n",
      "## Selenium\n",
      "* Uses WebDriver API: soon to become W3C standard\n",
      "* Works across multip browsers\n",
      "* Client libraries in many languages\n",
      "* easy install\n",
      " \n",
      "## Testing responsive sites\n",
      "```\n",
      "    self.driver.set_window_size(600, 600)\n",
      "    self.driver.set_window_size(1280, 800)\n",

      "## Testing visuals with Needle\n",
      "* [bfirsh/needle](https://github.com/bfirsh/needle)\n",
      "* based on selenium\n",
      "* catch regressions with styles, typography, SVG, images etc. by coparing screenshots\n",
      "```\n",
      "    self.assertScreenshot(\n",
      "        '.banner',  # CSS selector\n",

      "    )\n",
      "```\n",
      "* First time you run the test, pass a flag to tell Needle to save the screen shot\n",
      "```\n",
      "    $ nosetests tests:BannerTest --with-save-baseline\n",
      "```\n",
      "* Helps you check for CSS changes\n",
      "* creates a visual diff image... cooooool!\n",
      "\n",
      "### Tips\n",
      "* Baseline screenshots == Fixtures\n",
      " * Store them in your repo\n",
      "* ensure consistency between environments to avoid false positives\n",
      " * browser version, fonts, etc.\n",
      " * Use configuration management!\n",

      "## Continuous Integration\n",
      "\n",
      "### Headless browsers\n",
      "* Xvfb\n",
      " * `$ xvfb --run  # run next command in the virtual framebuffer`\n",
      "* PyVirtualDisplay\n",
      "* PhantomJS\n",
      "\n",
      "### Sauce Labs\n",
      "* run remotely in the cloud\n",
      "* gives access to multiple browsers and multiple platforms\n",
      "* parallel tests\n",
      "* video recording of all sessions\n",
      "\n",
      "## Speed and Robustness\n",
      "\n",
      "### Optimizing for speed\n",
      "* use PhantomJS (headless mode)\n",
      "* Use parallelization\n",
      " * `nostests --processes=10`\n",
      "\n",
      "### Optimizing for robustness\n",
      "* Pin down versions for your whole software stack, including the browser\n",
      "* Master the use of explicit waits, esp. with heavy JS/Ajax apps\n",

      "## A Word of Caution\n",
      "* Integration & Functional tests are slow; use them with moderation\n",
      "* use selenium only for what a dummy test client may not already achieve\n",
      "\n",
      "## Integration frontend/backend\n",
      "* ensure that the user interface rworks\n",
      "* have fun in the process and functional test are important\n",
      "* increase confidence\n",
