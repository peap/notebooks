    "## The ORM\n",
    "\n",
    "### Database Backends\n",
    "There are a set of classes used to support the four built-in backends, plus a base class that can be used to write your own backend for un-supported databases or database drivers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `SQLCompiler`\n",
    "This is the bridge between high-level queries and the database backend.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's very complex code.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the magic happens in `as_sql()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `Query`\n",
    "Data structure and methods representing a database query. It's a tree-like data structure. \n",
    "\n",
    "Two flavors: \n",
    "- `Query`: normal ORM operations\n",
    "- `RawQuery`: real, custom SQL queries, that returns something resembling what a normal `Query` would expect\n",
    "\n",
    "Also scary, complex code. It has to support infinite and arbitrary chaining of ORM methods (`.filter()`, `.distinct()`, etc.). Most of the code comes from this merging process.\n",
    "\n",
    "You shouldn't often need to subclass `Query`, but rather `QuerySet`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Custom Lookups\n",
    "All your custom stuff gets access to the Django internals, like `as_sql()` and the `SQLCompiler` instance. Some ways to do custom stuff:\n",
    "- `F objects`\n",
    "- `Q objects`\n",
    "- `django.db.models.Lookup`\n",
    "- `django.db.models.Transform`\n",
    "\n",
    "### `QuerySet`\n",
    "Wraps `Query` in a nice API. It's lazy; doesn't touch the database until you force it to, by calling a method that doesn't return a `QuerySet`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Printing a `QuerySet`, say, in the Django shell, it'll only show the first 21 objects... `__repr__` adds a `LIMIT 21` to the query, so that you don't accidentally run out of memory trying to build a string with a million results in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a container - it stores results to a cache that is only every populated once.\n",
    "\n",
    "All operations except for iteration and length/existence checks perform a new query and return a new QuerySet. So you can't get a `QuerySet` of several objects, update an attribute on one object, save it, and see the result in the same `QuerySet`.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's an `update()` method on `QuerySet`, but it doesn't call custom `save()` methods or send `pre_save` or `post_save` signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `defer()` and `only()` methods allow you get only the specified fields, but you get actual `Model` instances. If you access other fields, then a new query is performed. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `values()` and `values_list()` get you field values, not `Model` instances. With `flat=True`, `values_list()` gets you a flat list of all values in the `QuerySet`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `select_related()` method solves the N+1 problem for `ForeignKey` and `OneToOneField` relations - just one SQL query, instead of one for the first model, and one for each of the N results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `prefetch_related()` method solves it for `ManyToManyField`s and `GenericRelation`s - one query for model, relations resolved in python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `Manager`\n",
    "The high-level interaface. The `Model` that the `Manager` is attached to is available in the `Manager` as `self.model`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a model has multiple `Manager`s, the first one defined is the default (`Model._default_manager`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Should always have a `Manager` on your model that can get alllll the objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `Model`\n",
    "Representation of the data and the associated logic.\n",
    "- one class = one table\n",
    "- one field = one column\n",
    "- one instance = one row\n",
    "\n",
    "Uses python metaclasses, via `django.db.models.base.ModelBase`. This is how the `Meta` class property is created. It also creates all those extra methods and properties on the class, like `Model.DoesNotExist`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`ModelBase` calls `contribute_to_class()` on each thing in the attribute dictionary of the new class. For example, `DateTimeField` has a `contribute_to_class()` method that adds the `get_next_by_<field-name>` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `Field`\n",
    "Custom fields can pretend to be another field by setting internal type to something that exists already.\n",
    "\n",
    "`to_python()` converts from DB-level type to correct Python type.\n",
    "\n",
    "`value_to_string()` converts to string for serialization purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple other methods for preparing values for various kinds of DB-level usage - querying, storage, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Inheritance\n",
    "Multiple types available:\n",
    "- abstract parents\n",
    " - Indicated by `abstract = True` in model's `Meta` declaration\n",
    " - doesn't create a database table\n",
    " - subclasses, if not abstract, generate a table with both their own fields and those of the abstract parent\n",
    "- multi-table\n",
    " - no special syntax; just subclass the parent model\n",
    "- proxy models\n",
    " - set `proxy = True` in `Meta`\n",
    " - will reuse parent's table and fields; only allowed changes are at the python level\n",
    " - can define additional methods, manager, etc.\n",
    " - queries return instances of the model queried\n",
    " \n",
    "#### Unmanaged models\n",
    "Related to proxy models. Set `managed = False` in `Meta`. Wraps a database or view that you don't want Django to... manage. \n",

    " - search for django forms 508 accessibility for examples/libraries of ensuring Section 508 accessibility compliance\n",
    " \n",
    "### ModelForms\n",
    "Introspects a `Model` and creates a `Form` out of it. Uses the model meta API to get list of fields, etc.\n",
    "- good place to find examples for how to use the model meta API\n",
    "- calls the `formfield()` method on each field\n",
    " - can be overridden by defining the `formfield_callback()` method on the Form\n",
