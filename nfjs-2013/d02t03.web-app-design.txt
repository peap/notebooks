Talk intended for internal Enterprise apps, not public-facing stuff

What are the big pain points that make Enterprise Web Apps suck?
-- Condescending (forms with lots of errors, for example)
-- Intrusive (like Windows rebooting itself)
-- Unfocused

If your "customers" could trade up, they probably would.

Help your users feel empowered, smart, and productive.

Web apps should be intuitive, forgiving, and frictionless.

Talk to your users!
-- What do you do?
-- How do you do it?
-- What's missing?
-- Sit down with client and business analyst, shadow, etc.
-- Just take a paper and pen.
-- Personas provide a human face to the project to establish empathy

Then ignore them
-- users get needy
-- constant firefighting mode
-- clutter, complications, and eventually more bugs
-- Need to establish a line before it gets to personalized to the users and
becomes too complex

Don't break the mental model of your users (saving with tabs, trash can, etc.)

Focus
-- one app = one intent
-- one page = one task

Tips and Tricks
-- Just use CSS3
-- Use reset.css
-- SASS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) - gives you variables and math
-- Colors: don't pick them yourself

Be playful (fun messages, etc.)
Be insightful
Be helpful
