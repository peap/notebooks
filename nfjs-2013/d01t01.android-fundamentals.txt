Main Android site: developer.android.com
Android Dashboard: developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html

Platform: new apps can just target Android 4+ (API v. 15+)
Screen size: just need to develop for ~4.5" screens and ~7" screens and you'll be fine

Paradigm: layout with components, event-driven
-- screen with all components ("widgets") = "activity"
-- clicking is not an event, but rather an "intent"

One-time $25 fee to add all your apps to the Google Play Store

Android isn't _really_ Java; it feels closest to Java 6
Android Studio is version 0.1.5...and it feels like it.
-- uses Gradle build
-- will likely become the standard, when it's ready to go
Google API adds some features on top of Android API

You have to run on either a connected device or an emulator
-- emulator takes a long time to start up; most people leave it open all day

Layouts are written in XML; they get compiled into Java classes.
Devs usually stick with built-in components.
Android apps all have the same basic code layout
Always want to call super on override methods
Every app needs one MainActivity
All activities need to be in the manifest to be recognized by the OS
Changing orientation kills the activity and instantiates a new one
