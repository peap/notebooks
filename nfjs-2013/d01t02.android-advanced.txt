The activity life-cycle:
-- http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html
-- more methods than states

Good REST template library:
-- spring android core + spring android rest template
-- add .jar files to libs

Can't run a long-running task in the GUI thread
-- you're supposed to do it asynchronously (AsyncTask)

Adapter
--  like a cell model or table model from Swing
-- maps data structure to widget

Persistence
-- file access to device through java.io
-- input files for the app go in res/raw
----- InputStream is = getResources().openRawResources(R.raw.resfile)
-- XML in res/xml; XmlPullParser is built in to Android
-- writing preferences - you need to commit changes

GCM: Google Cloud Messaging system
-- push message to all deployed apps
-- added Google service

RDBMS
-- annoying API, but there is a workaround
-- no jdbc
-- don't want to do much database access, though: put most data on a server
-- android.database
-- SQLite is built-in (actual SQLite)
-- ORMLite is available
-- have to create a DBAdapter to manage db creation/recreation
