Gradle is the up and coming build suite (?) for Android

Not much testing build into Android

"Unit tests" are actually integration tests
-- Dalvik virtual machine (DVM)
-- actually need an emulator or device to run the "unit test", but it actually
deploys your app

Android lint also built in; very useful

Until gradle, you make your tests in a separate android test project

Robotium is an intuitive, simpler test framework

Robolectric is an attempt to make the "unit tests" actual unit tests; emulates
Android OS in the IDE

Also, Spoon: run tests across many devices with screenshots and very nice output

monkeyrunner - drive a device with a python script

ProGuard shrinks, optimizes, and obfuscates your code into an .apk

Testdroid is a service to test your app on ~200 devices ($1500/month or $0.99 per run)

Gradle
-- run tests as part of your project, on all devices simultaneously
-- Gradle is a DSL
-- gradle scripts are written in Groovy
