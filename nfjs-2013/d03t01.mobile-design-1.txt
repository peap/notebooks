MOBILE IS A BIG DEAL

Use personas to design your software
-- Humanize your users!
-- We respond to faces. Give your persona a face
-- Make up a person with a face and many specific details
-- Give him/her an (alliterative) name - Betty to the Busy Mom

Use ethnography to study your users in their environment

Consider mindsets in the mobile space
-- what do people want/expect with your app

What is absolutely, ABSOLUTELY required?
-- pixels are very precious
-- cut more than you think you need to

We don't have perfect cell/WiFi coverage yet
-- sprites, minified JS, HTML5, canvases instead of images, lazy load, app cache, etc.
-- makes desktop experience better, too

Users are distracted; usage tends to be choppy. Sprints, not marathons.

Activity zones
-- where you can reach with one thumb (but the left or the right?)
-- toolbars tend to be located at the bottom of apps now
----- easier to reach
----- doesn't block the content

Try to interact with your app while moving your hand in circles (blurry vision)

Gestures are often ignored; they are not easily discoverable

Many interface elements are hidden
