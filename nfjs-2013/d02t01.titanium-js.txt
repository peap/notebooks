Titanium SDK
-- develop in JavaScript with proprietary framework (JS only; no HTML or CSS)
-- bridges your code to target platform (doesn't generate native code)
-- creates native widgets
-- targets: iOS, Androis, Mobile Web (perpetual Beta), Windows, Blackberry
-- Titanium Studio (Eclipse w/plugins) is available, but not required

Can do platform-specific stuff, like action bar for Android, split-pane view for iOS
-- Write once, then adapt to iOS and Android

Titanium API supports almost all native features

JavaScript is still single-threaded; very much like web JS (just no DOM)
Heavily event-based

Trip Lingo analysis of their Titanium app
-- 100% of non-UI code is reusable (20% of code-base)
-- 50% of UI code is reusable (80% of code-base)
-- UI code can become more reusable with experience and patterns

Still worth knowing the native toolchain for the platform you're targeting, at
least for debugging ability

Titanium is based on modules
-- Ti has a JS runtime that loads modules (networking, database, filesystem, etc.)
-- each module represents an API

Use TiShadow to send code live to emulators
