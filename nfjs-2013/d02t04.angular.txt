Going to build a to-do app in this talk

Angular is an MV* framework
-- C? controller
-- VM? view model

Primary role of a controller is to introduce scope

Dependency injection: ask the framework for what you need
-- $scope: get a new scope object from Angular
-- $ is reserved for Angular dependencies

If you need to share things between controllers, use dependency injection

Login and session management are talks in themselves
