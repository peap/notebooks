Getting the Most out of jQuery Widgets
- Richard Lindsey, The Advisory Board Company

What's a widget?
* reusable 
* think small
* think modular
* elements/compounds/cells/organisms

Communicate through events, rather than direct communication
* Keep components decoupled
* Make them subscribe and respond; jQuery and jQuery UI have an
event system
* Bundle smaller modules into a parent module; parent can then subscribe to its
children
* Provide a public API
* Direct references should only go downward
 * "Parents should directly consume their children."

Public functions should always have unit tests

Only make components as large as they need to be
Keep them as decoupled as possible
Consume downwards, communicate upwards
Keep everything as small as possible
Test, test test!
Ensure backward compatibility for your consumers.
