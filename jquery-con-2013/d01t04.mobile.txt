Using jQuery Mobile to Build Device-Agnostic Pages
- Asta Gindulyte

We need to re-do our website...
What has changed over the past 5 years?
...we have many web-capable devices.
Need to make website work on all devices.

What's a non-device-agnostic website? A site that works better on some devices
than others.
Device-agnostic website: works well on all devices

Challenges:
* screen size
  * page width should adjust
  * text should be large enough to read
* touch (no correlation with screen size anymore)
  * buttons/ links should be big enough
  * swipe and other gestures should be enabled
* content organization
  * show/hide based on screen size might penalize small screen users
  * having very different layouts might confuse users
* testing
  * no free lunch - need to test on all devices
  * emulators like screenfly (quirktools.com/screenfly) can help, though

Why jQuery Mobile?
* "write less, do more" (especially, less CSS)
* cross-browser, cross-device
* touch-friendly
* responsive since version 1.3
* layout and themeing engine
* AJAX page navigation
* great docs!

Example sites:
* pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/logo/
* testpubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/

jQuery mobile has a collapsible widget that can be made into a tree display
(timers...)

If you're making an app-like website, jQuery Mobile might be a better choice
than Bootstrap
