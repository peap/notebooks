Digging, Debugging
- Brian Arnold

Know the language...read JavaScript: The Definitive Guide, not just The Good Parts

The Chrome console/inspector is awesome

inspect() is a built-in function to inspect an element

$0 refers to the last-inspected element, $1 the previous, $2, etc.

$_ is assigned to the result of the last evaluation expression

dir() is a built-in function to see what's in an object, including DOM nodes

Setting breakpoints and conditional breakpoints are handy
* insert 'debugger;' into your code to start up the debugger
* there are also DOM breakpoints and XHR breakpoints

Sources tab in Chrome dev tools is really handy, too

Profile tab, flame chart...way cool

Private Mode is a great tool for debugging
* no cache, no cookies, etc.

Use a style guide...make it consistent!
