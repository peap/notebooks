Push notifications for the web

Agenda
* Messaging
* Push API and SimplePush (Mozilla)
* AeroGear
* Code
* Questions

Lots of existing frameworks for the various mobile platforms

SimplePush
* subscribe to an endpoint
* version numbers are send to registered endpoints
* client checks version number and updates if out of date

"Standard" Push API in development is now very similar to SimplePush

AeroGear
* websockets-based (simplepush server)
* sock.js: XHR-streaming if browser doesn't support websockets (native android
browser, for example)
* unifiedpush server
