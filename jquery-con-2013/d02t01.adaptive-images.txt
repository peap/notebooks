Adaptive Images for Responsive Web Design
- Christopher Schmitt

There are lots of solutions for responsive image size...

Media queries and CSS was what his talk was about.

Workarounds and tricks
* background: 100%
* use SVG images if you can (IE 9+)
* font-based solutions (unicode; not great for accessibility)
