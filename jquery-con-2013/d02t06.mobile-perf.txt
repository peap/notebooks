jQuery Mobile: Optimizing Performance
- Alex Schmitz

Why do we need to optimize performance?
* speed of cell connections
* hardware

Simplify your pages
* reduce number of widgets
* reduce size
* limit size of lists/tables
* paginate

Reduce download time and HTTP requests
* combine scripts
* minify

...too fast for notes

Use custom builds of jQuery-mobile
* reduce file size
* reduce library initialization size
* reduce page initialization time
* allows you to remove parts of the library you don't need
