Keynote - The State of jQuery
- Dave Methvin, President of jQuery Foundation

jQuery Foundation Initiatives
* support jQuery projects
* support web developers
* support web standards
* advocate for developer needs
* participate in standards process
 * W3C
 * ECMA 262 (JavaScript)

jQuery Core Plan
* 1.x still supports IE 6/7/8
* 2.x supports modern browsers
* both maintained by the team

1.x/2.x APIs stay in sync
* 1.9 January
* 2.0 April
* 1.10 June
* 1.10.0 <---> 2.0.0
* 1.11.0 <---> 2.1.0

jQuery Migrate Plugin
* identifies things your code is doing that jQuery 1.9+ doesn't support anymore
* actually makes older code work
* lets you use jQuery 1.9+ with code that hasn't been upgraded yet

1.11/2.1
* Uses AMD
* Ability to make custom builds
* JIT feature detection
* Beta coming out within a month
* Try it out!
* Tries to lower overhead

Layout
* Browser layout recalculation/redrawing makes a big impact
* layout: changes to the document that potential affect dimensions
* forced layout: layout change that asks the browser about the new dimensions
before the function returns, which causes the browser to drop everything and
answer
 * eg: asking for the width of an element you've just changed (offsetWidth
 function takes a lot of time)
* Infinite scroll: full-page forced layout on every scroll event (facebook...)
 * using grid layouts can help because it allows you to calculate how
 much content you need to fill, rather than making the browser do it
* $(':hidden') vs. $('.hidden')
 * :hidden if a jQuery selector extension - can't use fast native DOM selector code
 * using this selector is to ask for all hidden elements on the page: forced re-flow
 * .hidden, on the other hand, is a native class selection; fast, no forced layout
* Can also avoid forced layout by throttling high frequency events like
mousemove or scroll; handle with requestAnimationFrame
