The building blocks of a developer-inclusive culture
- Monika Piotrowicz, Shopify (who acquired JetCooper)

Process
* a process exists to support creativity, not resist it

Good conference, but how do you get to apply the cool new things?

Waterfall approach might prevent implementation of new ideas
* we're not part of the design/discovery phase, generally
* we become short order cooks
* we need a way to share ideas
* we want to work with designers (don't look at them as problem creators)

What JetCooper did

Devs inside the project
* stopped staggering (waterfall): design and development at the same time
* start sitting with the designers to see what they're thinking about and
to discuss the project
* Research & Prototype
  * the chance to actually learn about and implement the new things that interest
  you
  * Your sandbox/prototyping
    * the freedom to focus on one problem at a time, testing early to solve it
    faster
  * share and iterate
    * design informs development; development informs design

Devs outside the project
* demo days: cross-studio learning
* developer meetings and lightning talks
* hack days and recess
  * couple days, company wide
  * stop working on normal stuff, hack around

Lessons learned
* it's a lot to implement, but a strong developer culture can bring a lot of
benefits
* what they've gained
  * they make more informed decisions
  * time is reduced and quality increases
  * happy developers

What do to?
* talk to your designers
* become an advocate for a stronger culture
* take the first step - go to early project meetings
