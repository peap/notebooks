<!-- don't use CSS for width and height -->
<canvas id="cancan" width="400" height="300">
  You don't support <canvas> if you see this...
</canvas>

Have to get the rendering context, then draw on it.

var canvas = document.getElementById('cancan');
var context = canvas.getContext('2d');
--- or ---
var $canvas = $('#cancan');
var context = $canvas[0].getConext('2d');

$canvas.css({
    'background-color': '#fff',
    'border-color': '#000',
});

then you draw using context methods...
