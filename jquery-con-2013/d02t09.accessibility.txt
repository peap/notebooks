Talk to Me: Making websites accessible
- Joern Zaefferer

About 300 million people worldwide have low-vision

How to convince your boss:
* Accessibility is important, like UX or security
* Boost your user experience
  * accessible websites are more usable for everyone
* support power users
  * keyboard access for everyone
* SEO improvements
  * meaningful markup for screen-readers and search engines
* more customers
  * online shopping is much more useful for home-bound users
* it's the law
  * USA: Section 508
  * Canada: Common Look and Feel Standards 2.0

What to do...
* CAPTCHAs need audio equivalents
* use W3C Validator
* Keyboard testing; make sure tabs work and you can use all links and form elements

Testing Screenreaders
* NVDA: Firefox, Windows
* VoiceOver: Mac
* Jaws: Windows-only, biggest market share, 14-minute demo (put it in a VM and
pause VM)

Virtual Cursor: a speaking DOM tree

Headers, links, forms, and landmarks (role attribute) are like the GOTO of
screenreaders

Unexpected screen changes are among the biggest complaints, along with flash
and CAPTCHAs. Use aria-live="polite" and aria-atomic="true".
