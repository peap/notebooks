AngularJS requires a different way of thinking

Imperative vs. Declarative

imperative initialization
* select HTML element and call a method on it

declarative initialization
* use arbitrary data-* attributes to specify configuration
* then, initialize the html

configuration is rarely static
* ViewModels: good concept, bad reputation

AngularJS provides declarative initialization and two-way binding

A view model is created by Angular if you don't declare one

Directives
* ng-* are directives
* ng-app, ng-select, ng-repeat
* you can make your own

$scope
* the "ViewModel", for lack of a better name

Controller
* context in which you work with the scope
* can't access the DOM from the controller; have to write your own directive
