Grunt: http://gruntjs.com/
* runs on nodejs

Continuous Integration
* things you do when you release, except all the time, on every commit

Example of setting up CI in an existing project using Travis-CI: https://travis-ci.org/
* Travis-CI has good github integration
* $0/month for open source projects
* $130/month for private repos

Things we want to accomplish:
* make `grunt test` work
  * PhantomJS: headless browser
  * .travis.yml
    * language: node_js
    * node_js: ["0.10"]
    * before_script: npm install -g grunt
* ensure we get emails when builds fail (setting in travis-gi github plugin)
* deploy upon successful commit
  * make `grunt deploy` work
    * heroku
    * nodejitsu
    * openshift
    * deploying your app with the above three is as simple as a `git push`
  * after_script: grunt deploy
  * get a github API token
  * secure variables for travis
